# ARRAY
- An array is a contiguous (unbroken without interuptions) of equal sized elements indexed by contiguous integers.

## Types of Arrays
- One dimentional array
- Multidimentional array
   
### MultiDimentional Array
- An array that contains one or more arrays within it.  
- They are useful for storing and manipulating data that can be modelled as a grid. i.e matrix, table and cube.

### Times for common operations
- To read and write elements of an array is order-1 (constant time)
- Adding and removing elements at the end of array is order-1 (constant time)
- Adding and removing elements at the beginning of array is order(n) (linear time)
- To add and remove elements in the middle of array is O(n) (linear time)
